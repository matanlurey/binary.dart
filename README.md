## Getting started

Using `package:binary` is easy, we have almost no dependencies. Use `pub add`:

```bash
dart pub add binary
```

Then, import the package and start using it:

```dart
import 'package:binary/binary.dart';

// Start using package:binary.
```

If you are not familiar with [extension methods][] and [extension types][], it
is worth reading the documentation before using this package, which has heavy
use of extensions for most functionality. A small primer is instead of writing
something like:

```dart
void main() {
  // Old API in version <= 0.1.3:
  print(toBinaryPadded(0x0C, 8)); // 00001100
}
```

You now use `toBinaryPadded` (and other methods) as an _extension_ method:

```dart
void main() {
  // New API.
  print(0x0C.toBinaryPadded(8)); // 00001100
}
```

## Usage

This package provides a few sets of APIs extension methods and boxed classes.

> See the [API docs](https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/binary/latest) for
> complete documentation.

Most users will use the extension methods on `int` or `String`:

```dart
// Uses "parseBits" (on String) and "shiftRight" (on int).
void main() {
  test('shiftRight should work identical to >>> in JavaScript', () {
    expect(
      '0111' '1111'.bits.shiftRight(5, 8),
      '0000' '0011'.bits,
    );
  });
}
```

For convenience, extension methods are also present on `List<int>`:

```dart
// Uses "rotateRight" (on List<int>).
void main() {
  test('rotateRight should work similarly to int.rotateRight', () {
    final list = ['0110' '0000'.bits];
    expect(
      list.rotateRight(0, 1).toBinaryPadded(8),
      '0011' '0000',
    );
  });
}
```

There are also some specialized extension methods on the `typed_data` types:

- `Uint8List`, `Int8List`
- `Uint16List`, `Int16List`
- `Uint32List`, `Int32List`

### Boxed Types

It is possible to sacrifice performance in order to get more type safety and
range checking. For apps or libraries where this is a suitable tradeoff, we
provide these boxed types/classes:

- `Bit`
- `Int4` and `Uint4`
- `Int8` and `Uint8`
- `Int16` and `Uint16`
- `Int32` and `Uint32`

### Bit Patterns

There is also builder-type API for generating patterns to match against bits.
The easiest way to explain this API is it is _like_ `RegExp`, except for
matching and capturing components of bits:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create a BitPattern.
  final $01V = BitPatternBuilder([
    BitPart.zero,
    BitPart.one,
    BitPart.v(1),
  ]).build();

  // Match it against bits.
  print($01V.matches('011'.bits)); // true

  // Capture variables (if any), similar to a RegExp.
  print($01V.capture('011'.bits)); // [1]
}
```

## Compatibility

This package is intended to work identically and well in both the standalone
Dart VM, Flutter, and web builds of Dart and Flutter (both in DDC and Dart2JS).
As a result, there are no built-in ways to access integers > 32-bit provided (as
web integers are limited).

Feel free to [file an issue][] if you'd like limited support for 64 and 128-bit.
