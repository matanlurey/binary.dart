/// An unsigned 32-bit integer.
///
/// This type is _not_ explicitly boxed, and uses [extension types][]; that
/// means that _any_ [int] value _can_ be used as an Uint32, but only values
/// in the range of [min] and [max] are considered valid.
///
/// [extension types]: https://dart.dev/language/extension-types
///
/// ## Constructing
///
/// For most use cases, use the default [Uint32.new] constructor:
/// ```dart
/// Uint32(3); // 3
/// ```
///
/// In _debug_ mode, an assertion is made that the value is in a valid range;
/// otherwise, the value is wrapped, if necessary, to fit in the valid range.
/// This behavior can be used explicitly with [Uint32.fromWrapped]:
///
/// ```dart
/// Uint32.fromWrapped(Uint32.max + 1); // <min>
/// ```
///
/// See also:
/// - [Uint32.fromClamped], which clamps the value if it is out of range.
/// - [Uint32.tryFrom], which returns `null` if the value is out of range.
///
/// ## Operations
///
/// In most cases, every method available on [int] is also available on an
/// Uint32.
///
/// Some methods that only make sense for unsigned integers are not available
/// for signed integers, and vice versa, and some methods that are typically
/// inherited from [num], but not useful for integers, are not available; these
/// can still be accessed through the underlying [int] value, using [toInt]:
///
/// ```dart
/// Uint32(3).toInt().toStringAsExponential(); // "3e+0"
/// ```
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// Extension types are lightweight, but they are _not_ completely type-safe;
/// any [int] can be casted to an Uint32, and will bypass the range checks;
/// we believe that the performance benefits outweigh the risks, but it is
/// important to be aware of this limitation.
///
/// This also applies to methods such as [List.cast] or [Iterable.whereType].
