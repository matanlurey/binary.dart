# CHANGELOG

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Version 4.0.0 has a _large_ set of breaking changes, including removing the
> vast majority of extension methods and boxed classes, in favor of using the
> newer _extension types_ feature in Dart. I would be opening to adding back
> some deprecated methods, or a `lib/compat.dart` file if there is demand;
> please [file an issue][] if you need this.

## 4.0.0-alpha+7

- Added `<Int>.lsb`.
- Removed bit-operations from `IntExtension`; they are too easy to use
  incorrectly in the JS VM.

## 4.0.0-alpha+6

- Just kidding, `checkRange` will return `{{Int}}` if no error is thrown.

## 4.0.0-alpha+5

- `<Int>.checkRange` returns the `int` if no error was thrown (instead of
  `void`).

## 4.0.0-alpha+4

- Actually publish the contents of `4.0.0-alpha+3`.

## 4.0.0-alpha+3

**New features**:

- Added `<Int>.maxInt` and `<Int>.minInt` as static (`int`) constants.

## 4.0.0-alpha+2

**Breaking changes**:

- `<FixedInt>`, which was pointless, is now just `int`. That means that any
  fixed integer representation can be provided somewhere an `int` is expected,
  which cuts down on boilerplate without much value.

## 4.0.0-alpha+1

**New features**:

- Added `BitList`, a compact `List<bool>` implementation that stores every
  element as a single bit, with implementations that are fixed-size and
  growable.

- Added `<FixedInt>.zero` and `<FixedInt>.one` as static constants.

- Added `collectBytes()`, a utility to convert a `Stream<List<int>>` into a
  `Uint8List`.

**Breaking changes**:

- Replaced `<FixedInt>.bits` with `<FixedInt>.toBitList()`:

  ```diff
  - final bits = Int8(0).bits;
  + final bits = Int8(0).toBitList();
  ```

## 4.0.0-alpha

**New features**:

Lots and lots. It will be easier to just read the API documentation.

**Breaking changes**:

_Basically everything_. The entire API has been restructured to use extension
types, and some APIs removed entirely that were either not well-thought out
(_oops_) or were unnecessary:

- `Integral`, which was a base type for defining integers, has been removed in
  favor of a helper class, `IntDescriptor`, which is used to define new integer
  types, and acts sort of a meta type or poor man's macro for defining features:

  ```diff
  - class Int4 extends Integral<Int4> {
  -   Int4(int value) : super.checked(value, signed: true, size: 4);
  -
  -   @override
  -   Int4 wrapSafeValue(int value) => Int4(value);
  - }

  + extension type const Int4._(int _) implements FixedInt {
  +   static const _descriptor = _IntDescriptor<Int8>.signed(
  +     Int4.fromUnchecked,
  +     width: 4,
  +     max: 7,
  +   );
  +
  +   factory Int4(int v) => _descriptor.fit(v);
  +
  +   // ...
  + }
  ```

  In practice, it is much more difficult to implement a custom type, as many
  methods have to be hand-written, but it is also a much better future-proof
  approach. In the near-term, it's possible we could expose the code generator
  used by this package internally as a tool for others to use, and longer-term
  [Dart macros](https://dart.dev/language/macros) can be used to simplify this
  process for users.

- Fixed-size integers still exist, but with an updated API. Replacements are a
  follows:

  - `.bitChunk(l, r)` -> `.chunk(l, [s?])`
  - `.bitRange(l, r)` -> `.slice(l, [r?])`
  - `.bitsSet` -> `.countOnes()`
  - `.clearBit(n)` -> `.setNthBit(n, false)`
  - `.getBit(n)` -> `.nthBit(n)` or `operator [n]`
  - `.replaceBitRange(l, r, b)` -> `.replace(l, r?, b)`
  - `.rotateLeftShift(n)` -> `.rotateLeft(n)`
  - `.rotateRightShift(n)` -> `.rotateRight(n)`
  - `.setBit(n)` -> `.setNthBit(n)`
  - `.signExtend(n)` -> _removed_.
  - `.size` has been removed in favor of a static `.width`; as extension types
    are non-virtual.
  - `.toggleBit(n)` -> `.toggleNthBit(n)`
  - `.value` -> `.toInt()`

- The extension methods `BinaryInt` were removed. Instead, use the extension
  types directly. A small subset of helper methods are available on
  `IntExtension` but have little in common with the previous API (mostly
  convenience methods).

- Every other extension method set was removed.

## 3.0.1

- Downgrade [meta](https://pub.dev/packages/meta) version to [v1.7.0](https://pub.dev/packages/meta/versions/1.7.0) for Flutter compatibility.

## 3.0.0

Wooho: **ðŸŽ‰ Added support for Dart SDK 2.17.0 and Null Safety ðŸŽ‰**

Changes are relatively minor, some code that threw an `ArgumentError` on a
null value now fails statically, but otherwise there are no behavioral changes
to well-behaving code.

_Special thanks to <https://github.com/leynier> for driving this update!_

## 2.0.0

**Highlights**:

Added limited support for operations on integer values that exceed 32-bits.
Before `2.0.0` most of the methods provided by this package had undefined
behavior when accessing a bit > the 31st bit when compiled to JavaScript:

- `msb`
- `getBit`
- `setBit` and `isSet`
- `clearBit` and `isCleared`
- `toggleBit`
- `countSetBits`
- `bitRange` and `bitChunk`
- `hiLo`
- `toBinary` and `toBinaryPadded`

In addition, these operations will now throw `UnsupportedError` when compiled
to JavaScript when attempting operations on integer values that exceed 52-bits,
which is the maximum integer that is supported in JavaScript VMs. The remaining
methods (i.e. `signedRightShift`, so on), unless otherwise documented are
assumed to have _undefined behavior_ when compiled to JavaScript.

> Tip: Don't want to consider all of that? You can always just use `Uint32`!

**Operating on Larger Ints**:

Added `<int>.hiLo()`, which returns a fixed 2-length `Uint32List` where
element 0 is the "hi" (upper bits) and element 1 is the "lo" (lower bits).
Because of platform limitations, "hi" may only include up to the 52nd bit.

Additionally, `Uint32List` has received new extension methods through the
extension class `BinaryUint64HiLo` (e.g. the result of `<int>.hiLo()`), which
simplifies operations for integers larger than 32 bits:

- `.hi` and `.lo` getters.
- `~` and `&` and `|` operators.
- `equals(Uint32List)` and `toInt()` methods.

These methods allow treating a `Uint32List` roughly as a 64-bit integer with
limited boxing. We may still consider adding a `Uint64` boxed `Integral` in a
future release, but you may also try using these other implemntations:

- [BigInt](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-core/BigInt-class.html)
- [Int64](https://pub.dev/documentation/fixnum/latest/fixnum/Int64-class.html)

**Additional Changes:**

- Added `<int>.pow(n)`, which is like `<dart:math>.pow` with a return of `int`.
- Added `<Integral>.signExtend(startSize)`.
- Removed all methods deprecated up to this point.
- Removed `<Integral>.[un]signed`, which was misleading for unsigned integers.
- Fixed a bug where `<int>.replaceBitRange` often emitted an incorrect result.
- Fixed a bug where `<int>.signExtend` often emitted an incorrect result.

## 1.7.0

- Deprecated `<*>.shiftRight` in favor of `<*>.signedShiftRight>`.
- Deprecated `<*>.rotateRight`, which was not correctly implemeted.
- Added `<*>.rotateRightShift` to replace `rotateRight`.
- Updated some doc comments that referred to incorrect JavaScript operators.

## 1.6.0

- Added `<BinaryInt|BinaryList|Integral>.toggleBit`.
- Deprecated `Integral.setBits` in favor of `.bitsSet`.

## 1.5.0

- Added `BitPatternGroup`'s constructor, deprecating `.toGroup()`.
- Added `BitPart.zero` and `BitPart.one` and deprecated `BitPart(int)`.

## 1.4.0

- Added `List<int>.toBits()` as a replacement for `List<int>.parseBits()`.
- Added `String.bits` as a replacement for `String.parseBits()`.
- Deprecated `List<int>.parseBits()` and `String.parseBits()`.
- Deprecated `int.as[U]Int{N}` functions in favor of manual wrapping.

## 1.3.0

- Added comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) to `Integral`.
- Added `<Integral>.checkRange` and `<Integral>.assertRange` static methods.
- Added the abiltiy to extend `Integral` to create custom-sized integers.

## 1.2.2

- Fixed a bug where `_InterpretedBitPattern` (the `BitPattern` generated from
  `BitPatternBuilder`) was sorted in an incorrect order (ascending instead of
  descending), which would not `match` correctly in some scenarios.

## 1.2.1

- Fixed a bug where `BitPatternBuilder.parse('00AA_AABB')` incorrectly threw a
  `FormatException` assuming that `_` deliniated the end of the `A` variable
  segment and the subsequent `A` was a _new_ segment (which is invalid). It now
  correctly parses the above as just two variable segments (`AAAA`, `BB`).

## 1.2.0

- Added `BitPatternBuilder.parse`, a simplified-format for building `BitPattern`
  from a string of alpha-numeric characters, where `0` and `1` are pre-defined
  (static) flags for matching, and charaters are variable segments:

  ```dart
  // Create a BitPattern (Data Structures).
  final $01V = BitPatternBuilder([
    BitPart(0),
    BitPart(1),
    BitPart.v(1, 'A'),
  ]).build();

  // Create a BitPattern (Parse a String).
  final $01Vs = BitPatternBuilder.parse('01A').build();
  print($01V == $01Vs); // true
  ```

- Fixed a bug where it was not possible to capture variables that were >8-bit.

## 1.1.0

- Added `BitPatternBuilder`, `BitPattern`, `BitPart`: a new API in order to
  build bit-based patterns and match against arbitrary sets of bits, optionally
  extracting variable names. This API is intended to make it easier to build
  apps and packages around implementing emulators and other decoders.

## 1.0.0

A large update to bring into line for Dart 2, as well take advantage of newer
langauge features like
[extension methods](https://dart.dev/guides/language/extension-methods) over
top-level methods. As a result, the new API is _not_ compatible with previous
versions, but migration should be trivial.

## 0.1.3

- Added `arithmeticShiftRight`

## 0.1.2

## 0.0.2

- Added `isNegative`, `hasCarryBit`, `doesAddOverflow`, `doesSubOverflow`,
  `mask`.
